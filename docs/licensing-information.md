### Licensing Information

With the purchase of both a Single License as well as an Extended License you are eligible to **3 months** of support after your purchase date. During this period you are able to ask questions relating to the .NET Core side of things as well as parts of the Theme itself and you are eligible to receive limited support for discussing modifications you are planning to make as part of your project. Please do note that extended support is **not** provided for the Seed edition of this product.

#### Extended Support

There is currently no possibility to purchase and/or otherwise obtain extended support for this product. If any plans are announced in the near future we will update our Licensing Terms in accordance with what WrapBootstrap provides, at which point we will inform you as well of the outcome and how it affects your purchase. There is always the possibility of purchasing another Single License to extend your support, but we do not want this to be your only option moving forward, so please stay stuned!

1. Theme Customization - **200 EUR**
